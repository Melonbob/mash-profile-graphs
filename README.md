## mash-profile-graphs
This is to be a collection of LaTeX and Rmarkdown source documents and instructions for generating target mash profile graphs.  While the below examples are nice, they are for one system that has its own set of contingencies and compromises.  They are also in metric units which most brewers in the US don't use.

Here is a LaTeX example for an infusion-modified RIMS mash: [b-I-TR-I-3stepBeta-2INF-TmR_3INFmash-out.pdf](https://github.com/Melonbob/mash-profile-graphs/files/8156059/b-I-TR-I-3stepBeta-2INF-TmR_3INFmash-out.pdf)

Here is one for a decoction- and infusion-modified RIMS mash: [b-TR-I-TR-D-TR-3stepBeta-TmR-2INF-TmR_3DEC-TmRmash-out.pdf](https://github.com/Melonbob/mash-profile-graphs/files/8156103/b-TR-I-TR-D-TR-3stepBeta-TmR-2INF-TmR_3DEC-TmRmash-out.pdf)
