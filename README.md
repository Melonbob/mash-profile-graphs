## Objective
These pages provide a starting point into creating custom graphs for beer brewing logs.  The process of brewing beer has many variables, the control of which starts with measurable targets and keeping records.

## Mash-profile Graphs
This is a collection of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) source documents and instructions for generating target mash-profile graphs.  While the below examples are nice, they are for one system that has its own set of contingencies and compromises (read rates of heating and heat losses and equipment limitations).  They are also in metric units which most brewers in the US don't use.  Each folder has preview pdfs available.
